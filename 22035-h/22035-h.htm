PREFACE</a></h4>

<hr class = "spacer">

<p>The following rhythmic plays compiled by Mr. John N. Richards of the
Newark Department of Physical Education have been devised to meet the
needs in the transition of Physical Education activities between the
kindergarten and the first few years of the primary school.</p>

<p>The physiologist tells us that the nervous organism of early
childhood is injured by the strain of strict, immobile attention
required in formal gymnastics. Therefore it is wise to hold the child's
interest and attention by means of dramatized nursery plays. These make
little strain on mental application and the child is able to dramatize
in motion the words and music which are planned to develop his motor
co-ordination. In this way the child is gradually and interestingly led
from the freedom of expression, characteristic of babyhood to the more
specialized formal activities of the third and fourth years in the
school.</p>

<p>Mr. Richards' contribution merits widespread usage because he has
clearly and definitely described his rhythm plays so that the classroom
teacher can easily make use of them without having to draw on her
imagination or having to guess at the written explanation.</p>

<p>The book should be useful and welcomed too, not only by the classroom
teacher but also by the specialist and supervisor of Physical
Education.</p>

INTRODUCTION</a></h4>

<hr class = "spacer">

<p>The young people of to-day are most fortunate in their opportunities
and advantages. The home, the school, the shop, social life and play
offer increasing fields for service. The ever increasing number of
problems which must be faced, in this reconstruction period of our
nation's life, demands leaders of broad intellect, clear vision and
sound judgment. Coupled with these qualifications there must be
developed a moral earnestness which will make for better
citizenship.</p>

<p>The trend of society movement is undoubtedly toward congested city
life. There is lamentable lack of playgrounds and properly equipped
gymnasiums. The school buildings are crowded to capacity and there is a
rush and hurry of life which challenges the attention of all educators
who are interested in the physical well-being of children.</p>

<p>The priceless assets of our communities are the boys and girls who
are growing into manhood and womanhood. We should spare neither expense
nor energy in fitting them physically, mentally and spiritually for the
great problems which will all too soon be theirs.</p>

<p>Exercise habits and a spirit of fair play must be a part of their
training from the early school days. There is no better way of
inculcating these lessons than through story plays and games during
their first school years.</p>

<p>The material contained in this book is practical. The exercise
movements have been set to music which is popular both in the schools
and in the homes. It is carefully graded and should prove to be of great
assistance to the teachers in the lower grades. It tends to bridge over
the gap between the Kindergarten and the Primary Grade activities.</p>

<p>There is need for a manual of this type in our Physical Training
literature and it is hoped that this material will be used generally
throughout the schools of our country.</p>

SUGGESTIONS FOR THE TEACHING OF THE GYMNASTIC ACTIVITY</a></h4>

<hr class = "spacer">

<p>1. Teach the words of the rhyme to the class, keeping in mind the
rhythm.</p>

<p>2. If in presenting the action, the movement is based upon certain
words as cues, present by imitation the activity as applied to the
words, <i>i.e.</i>, Little Jack Horner; Little Miss Muffet, etc.</p>

<p>3. If the movement is based on a time element (rhythm), present the
activity content, line by line, <i>i.e.</i>, Yankee Doodle; Pat-a-cake,
etc.</p>

<p>4. Be sure the rhyme and activity has been thoroughly mastered before
adding the song element.</p>

<p>5. If a dancing movement is involved, present same to the class as a
unit before combining with other movements, <i>i.e.</i>, Fly Away Jack
and Jill; Diddle, Diddle, Dumpling, etc.</p>

<p><i>The author wishes to express thanks to Miss Louise Westwood,
Director of Music of the Newark Public Schools, for the following
suggestions as to the teaching of the song element:</i></p>

<p><i>1. Pitch-pipes:</i></p>

<p>No song under any condition should be sung without the pitch of the
first word being given; using the pitch-pipe to get the key in which the
song is written.</p>

<p><i>2. Range of Songs:</i></p>

<p>All songs should be sung not lower than the first line E or higher
than the fifth line F of the staff. If songs are scored in another
range, transpose the song by changing the pitch of the <i>first</i>
word.</p>

<p><i>3. Quality of Tone:</i></p>

<p>All singing should be in a soft, light, head tone. Half-tone
quality.</p>

<p class = "center">
<i>No loud singing should be allowed at any time.</i></p>


<h5>PROCEDURE IN TEACHING</h5>

<p>1. Teach the rhyme. &nbsp; 2. Combine rhyme with the gymnastic
activity.<br>
3.&nbsp;Teach the song. &nbsp; 4.&nbsp;Combine No. 1, No. 2 and
No.&nbsp;3.</p>


<h5>COMMANDS USED TO PRESENT THE GYMNASTIC ACTIVITY AND SONG</h5>

<p>1. Determine key in which the song is written and find starting
note.</p>

<p>2. Teacher sounds keynote of first syllable or word.</p>

<p class = "center">
Command:&mdash;Pitch&mdash;Sing!</p>


<h5><i>Examples:</i></h5>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Yankee Doodle. The first syllable of the word, "Yankee,"
which is "Yank," is sung to establish the pitch.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Oh, where, oh where has my little dog gone? The first
word, "Oh," is sung to establish the pitch.</p>

<p>3. In order to insure united action, the following command is
used:</p>

<p class = "center">
Ready&mdash;Begin!</p>
